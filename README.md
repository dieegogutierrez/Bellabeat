Welcome to the Bellabeat Wellness Data Analysis project, which is part of the Google Data Analytics Capstone Project. In this analysis, we dive into wellness and fitness data to gain insights that can enhance the well-being of Bellabeat's customers. The following tools will be used: Google Sheets, Google Slides, Google BigQuery SQL, and Tableau.

The project will be completed by using the 6 Data Analytics stages:

1. Ask: Identify the business task and determine the key stakeholders.
2. Prepare: Collect the data, identify how it’s organized, determine the credibility of the data.
3. Process: Select the tool for data cleaning, check for errors and document the cleaning process.
4. Analyze: Organize and format the data, aggregate the data so that it’s useful, perform calculations and identify trends and relationships.
5. Share: Use design thinking principles and data-driven storytelling approach, present the findings with effective visualization. Ensure the analysis has answered the business task.
6. Act: Share the final conclusion and the recommendations.
